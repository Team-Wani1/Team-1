		<h1>My dream career in the real world</h1>
		<p>I am taking Computer Science studies, and I am very comfortable with Computer Science course. I really enjoy all the courses I've done and those that I'm doing currently. I find it very interesting to write codes and
		understanding how computers work. Programming computers is one of the tricky parts in computer science, You have to understand how computers work and program them. So I enjoyed programming languages where you actually
		talking with the computer. I'm learning C++, Java, Python and php. I intend to use these languages to develop best softwares for my customers. So basically I want to be a software engineer.</p
		<u><h2>What is Software Engineering</h2></u>
		<p>
			Software engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design, development and maintenance of software. Software engineering was introduced to address the issues of low-quality software projects. Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of quality. It ensures that the application is built consistently, correctly, on time and on budget and within requirements. The demand of software engineering also emerged to cater to the immense rate of change in user requirements and environment on which application is supposed to be working.
