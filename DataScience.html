	<h1>What is Data Science?</h1>
	<div class="fir">
		<p>Data scientists are a new breed of analytical data expert who have the technical skills to solve complex problems – and the curiosity to explore what problems need to be solved</p>

		<p>They’re part mathematician, part computer scientist and part trend-spotter. And, because they straddle both the 	business and IT worlds, they’re highly sought-after and well-paid. Who wouldn’t want to be one?</p>

		<p>They’re also a sign of the times. Data scientists weren’t on many radars a decade ago, but their sudden popularity reflects how businesses now think about big data. That unwieldy mass of unstructured information can no longer be ignored and forgotten. It’s a virtual gold mine that helps boost revenue – as long as there’s someone who digs in and unearths business insights that no one thought to look for before. Enter the data scientist.</p>

		<h2> Why I am Interested In Data?</h2>

		<p>
			I recently had the pleasure of attending the Deep Learning IndabaX in Durban this month 
			and that indaba really sparked an interest in me 
		</p>
		<p>
			I must say I learned a lot at that Indaba and it just spark a fire inside me to start learning on 
			my own machine learning and maybe someday I will be able to train machine models and become a Data science.
